# CometBites

## Concept
Our concept is a solution focused to overcome one of the major issues faced by the students of UTD every day and to upgrade 
the existing system to make their lives easier. The system needs to be revisited and rechecked considering the amount of 
growing lines at each food joint during the peak hours in our comet cafeteria. This is a game-changer constructed to overcome 
the long queues during the hungry times.

## Project Goals
CometBites is catered with meticulous attention to details by the students in aide to the significantly growing demands at 
the Comet Café for the students, all of which comes with just a tap on your mobile phone on our application. Our application 
usage is simple and understandable for any common user to save an ample amount of time that gets wasted in waiting periods. 
CometBites, along with tackling the growing lines and waiting time also provides the knowledge of what is available now to 
eliminate the frustration that is caused after standing in a food joint for 30 minutes only to find out the favorite bread 
or sauce is unavailable. This helps customers to save a lot of time that would be otherwise wasted every day just by standing 
in a line, while they could be anywhere else doing anything they want. 
Using the application, it is possible to reduce the hassle of getting stuck in the café traffic or missing classes, getting 
delayed for a class, etc. Ordering can be done online being anywhere and the time needed will be time to get to comet café to 
pick up the order placed. Ordering food for friends and family while standing in the line still takes a long time which 
involves preparing for multiple food items and packing extending the wait period even longer. Customers eventually lose 
patience and sometimes hunger. CometBites is a lifesaver to many who come across this issue every time heading hungry to the 
café and left with no other options. 
Though this is a great option only if the students want to avoid the line, online ordering has never been a failure for a 
crowded and fast food joints. This can be made possible as the students at the Comet Café expect a faster delivery to grab 
and go to their classes. Finally, for those who still want to place the order in person, kiosks will be available with a 
predefined list of options for each food joint. That way, the system can keep track of the orders using tickets, generated 
in similar fashion to the online ordering app. Thus, customers that choose to place the order in person will not face huge 
lines and will also benefit from features equivalent to the ones provided by the app.
